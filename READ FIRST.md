#Known Limitations
## Same folder
**If you run the program multiple times it will process the file again, and you could end up with a really long \lores\lores\lores\lores\etc folder structure. Until I implement a logging procedure to keep track of which files have been processed, I would recommend you to organize into an output folder then manually drop those files back into the orignal folder.**
**I'll try to get this bugfix updated this week, but no promises (super busy)**
